  abstract = {Agricultural land use results in multiple stressors affecting stream ecosystems. Flow reduction due to water abstraction, elevated levels of nutrients and chemical contaminants are common agricultural stressors worldwide. Concurrently, stream ecosystems are also increasingly affected by climate change. Interactions among multiple co-occurring stressors result in biological responses that cannot be predicted from single-stressor effects (i.e. synergisms and antagonisms). At the ecosystem level, multiple-stressor effects can be further modified by biotic interactions (e.g. trophic interactions). We conducted a field experiment using 128 flow-through stream mesocosms to examine the individual and combined effects of water abstraction, nutrient enrichment and elevated levels of the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) on survival, condition and gut content of juvenile brown trout and on benthic abundance of their invertebrate prey. Flow velocity reduction decreased fish survival (-12\% compared to controls) and condition (-8\% compared to initial condition), whereas effects of nutrient and DCD additions and interactions among these stressors were not significant. Negative effects of flow velocity reduction on fish survival and condition were consistent with effects on fish gut content (-25\% compared to controls) and abundance of dominant invertebrate prey (-30\% compared to controls), suggesting a negative metabolic balance driving fish mortality and condition decline, which was confirmed by structural equation modelling. Fish mortality under reduced flow velocity increased as maximal daily water temperatures approached the upper limit of their tolerance range, reflecting synergistic interactions between these stressors. Our study highlights the importance of indirect stressor effects such as those transferred through trophic interactions, which need to be considered when assessing and managing fish populations and stream food webs in multiple-stressor situations. However, in real streams, compensatory mechanisms and behavioural responses, as well as seasonal and spatial variation, may alter the intensity of stressor effects and the sensitivity of trout populations.},

We analyzed the concordance between neutral expectations and empirical observations at interaction, species, and network levels. We found that species abundance accurately predicts network metrics at all levels. Despite host-parasite systems being constrained by physiology and immunology, our results suggest that neutrality could also explain, at least partially, their structure.

  abstract = {Ecological network patterns are influenced by diverse processes that operate at different temporal rates. Here we analyzed whether the coupled effect of local abundance variation, seasonally phenotypic plastic responses, and species evolutionary adaptations might act in concert to shape network patterns. We studied the temporal variation in three interaction properties of bird species (number of interactions per species, interaction strength, and interaction asymmetry) in a temporal sequence of 28 plant-frugivore interaction networks spanning two years in a Mediterranean shrubland community. Three main hypotheses dealing with the temporal variation of network properties were tested, examining the effects of abundance, switching behavior between alternative food resources, and morphological traits in determining consumer interaction patterns. Our results demonstrate that temporal variation in consumer interaction patterns is explained by short-term variation in resource and bird abundances and seasonal dietary switches between alternative resources (fleshy fruits and insects). Moreover, differences in beak morphology are associated with differences in switching behavior between resources, suggesting an important role of foraging adaptations in determining network patterns. We argue that beak shape adaptations might determine generalist and specialist feeding behaviors and thus the positions of consumer species within the network. Finally, we provide a preliminary framework to interpret phylogenetic signal in plant-animal networks. Indeed, we show that the strength of the phylogenetic signal in networks depends on the relative importance of abundance, behavioral, and morphological variables. We show that these variables strongly differ in their phylogenetic signal. Consequently, we suggest that moderate and significant phylogenetic effects should be commonly observed in networks of species interactions.},

  abstract = {? 2015 Ecological Society of China. All Rights Reserved.Introduction of the metacommunity concept has made a substantial contribution to better understanding of community composition and dynamics of a fragmentized habitat at a regional level. Leibold and Miller defined metacommunity as a set of local communities that are linked by dispersal of multiple potentially interacting species. The metacommunity concept has provided a new and revolutionary paradigm for the community ecology by emphasizing integrated variation among communities at the regional level. This variation is accentuated by biotic interactions and spatial variation in environmental characteristics and modulated by dispersal among sites. The basic problems of metacommunity research are the multiple species coexistence mechanism, the reasons behind the diversity, and mechanism maintaining this diversity within the same system. Leibold and Miller proposed four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view, and the neutral view, each emphasizing different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. A variety of studies verified the four ecological paradigms, but only few addressed the terrestrial vertebrates system. In recent years, as a result of human activities and natural disturbances, Alashan Desert habitat in Inner Mongolia has been largely fragmentized. This habitat fragmentation is a major threat to animal communities. From 2010 to 2012, we investigate rodent communities and habitat environmental factors at eight fixed experimental sites in Inner Mongolia?s Alashan Desert. We used a set of full and partial redundancy analyses to estimate four additive partitions of variance in rodent species composition: (a) unexplained variation, (b) variation explained by spatial characteristics, (c) variation explained by local environmental conditions, and (d) variation explained by both spatial and environmental characteristics. The results of full and partial redundancy analyses showed that habitat and spatial characteristics alone accounted for 72.8\% and 33.8\%, respectively, of the variation among sites regarding rodent species composition. All explained variables accounted for approximately 86.5\% of the variation (P = 0.032) in rodent species composition among sites. Spatial characteristics accounted for 13.7\% of the variation (P = 0.246) in species composition after removing variation shared with habitat characteristics. Habitat characteristics accounted for 52.7\% (P = 0.016) of the variation in species composition after removing variation shared with spatial characteristics effect. Finally, spatial structured habitat characteristics (interaction term) accounted for approximately 20.1\% of the total variation in rodent species composition among sites. The environmental component to rodent species composition was greater than the spatial component. Pure environmental characteristics accounted for significant amounts of variation in rodent species composition, and pure spatial characteristics accounted for non-significant amounts of variation in rodent species composition. The results from variance decomposition suggested that the species sorting model of metacommunity structure fits better the rodent community than the mass effect or neutral models.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic diversity (PD) captures the shared ancestry of species, and is increasingly being recognized as a valuable conservation currency. Regionally, PD frequently covaries closely with species richness; however, variation in speciation and extinction rates and/or the biogeographic history of lineages can result in significant deviation. Locally, these differences may be pronounced. Rapid recent speciation or high temporal turnover of lineages can result in low PD but high richness. In contrast, rare dispersal events, for example, between biomes, can elevate PD but have only small impact on richness. To date, environmental predictors of species richness have been well studied but global models explaining variation in PD are lacking. Here, we contrast the global distribution of PD versus species richness for terrestrial mammals. We show that an environmental model of lineage diversification can predict well the discrepancy in the distribution of these two variables in some places, for example, South America and Africa but not others, such as Southeast Asia. When we have information on multiple diversity indices, conservation efforts directed towards maximizing one currency or another (e.g. species richness versus PD) should also consider the underlying processes that have shaped their distributions.},

  abstract = {1. According to the Stress Gradient Hypothesis, facilitation and competition are considered to be important at opposite ends of an environmental gradient. However, recent research has questioned the generality of this idea. One limitation is that the small-scale and short-term nature of much research into plant interactions limits our understanding of how their strength and importance changes over large temporal and spatial scales. 2. Here, we experimentally measured the interactions between bryophytes and a community of winter annuals in sand dunes along a c. 1500 km latitudinal gradient over two generations. We carried out bryophyte-removal experiments within permanent quadrates at eight field sites along the Atlantic coast of Western Europe, to measure the spatio-temporal variation in the strength and direction of biotic interactions. 3. We found a striking contrast in the nature of plant\textendash bryophyte interactions observed in consecutive years of study, using three measures of plant demographics: density, plant performance and population growth. In the first year facilitation dominated, but showed an overall decline in strength from south to north. In the following year facilitation was largely replaced by competition, which also declined in strength from south to north along the latitudinal gradient. 4. Interaction strengths are correlated with population growth rate, so that facilitation dominated in sites and years where population growth was low, whereas when population growth was high competition appeared to be more important. This is consistent with the Stress Gradient Hypothesis, but further to previous studies we demonstrate that this mechanism operates over time and in terms of population growth rates. 5. The effects of bryophyte removal were more strongly related to population density and population growth than to individual plant performance (i.e. reproductive output). This result suggests interactions are most important during germination and early establishment of annuals, and not in terms of inter-plant competition for resources. 6. Synthesis: This study is one of the first to show that there may be extreme spatio-temporal variation in the strength and direction of interactions, with substantial changes in their impact over a short time period. Our results suggest that the Stress Gradient Hypothesis may operate within and along gradients, as well as inter-annually. This may therefore play a role in buffering population dynamics.},

We develop generalized linear mixed-effects models (GLMM) that estimate the effect of both parties' phylogenetic history on trait evolution, both in isolation but also in terms of how the two histories interact. Using data on the incidence and abundance of 206 flea species on 121 mammal species, we illustrate our method and compare it to previously used methods for detecting host-parasite coevolution. At large spatial scales we find that the phylogenetic interaction effect was substantial, indicating that related parasite species were more likely to be found on related host species. At smaller spatial scales, and when sampling effort was not controlled for, phylogenetic effects on the number and types of parasite species harbored by hosts were found to dominate. We go on to show that in situations where these additional phylogenetic effects exist, then previous methods have very high Type I error rates when testing for the phylogenetic interaction. Our GLMM method represents a robust and reliable approach to quantify the phylogenetic effects of traits determined by, or defined by, ecological interactions and has the advantage that it can easily be extended and interpreted in a broader context than existing permutation tests.},

  abstract = {Ecologists increasingly recognize that a consideration of spatial dynamics is essential for resolving many classical problems in community ecology. In the present paper, I argue that understanding how trophic interactions influence population stability can have important implications for the expression of spatial processes. I use two examples to illustrate this point. The first example has to do with spatial determinants of food chain length. Prior theoretical and empirical work has suggested that colonization-extinction dynamics can influence food chain length, at least for specialist consumers. I briefly review evidence and prior theory that food chain length is sensitive to area. A metacommunity scenario, in which each of various patches can have a food chain varying in length (but in which a consumer is not present on a patch unless its required resource is also present), shows that alternative landscape states are possible. This possibility arises if top predators moderate unstable interactions between intermediate predators and basal resources. The second example has to do with the impact of recurrent immigration on the stability of persistent populations. Immigration can either stabilize or destabilize local population dynamics. Moreover, an increase in immigration can decrease average population size for unstable populations with direct density-dependence, or in predator-prey systems with saturating functional responses. These theoretical models suggest that the interplay of temporal variation and spatial fluxes can lead to novel qualitative phenomena.},

We tested the hypothesis that the mutualistic association between fire ants and aphids enhances the impact of fire ants on the herbivorous and predaceous arthropod community of cotton. We found that the presence of aphids attracted foraging fire ants onto cotton plants. This shift from ground to foliar foraging resulted in more frequent interactions between fire ants and arthropods associated with cotton. The survival of herbivores (caterpillars) and predators (ladybird beetles and lacewings) was lower in the presence of fire ants and aphids compared with fire ants alone in greenhouse experiments. Similarly, fire ants and aphids deterred plant bugs from spending time on cotton foliage. Using large-scale field manipulations of fire ants along with naturally occurring aphid populations, we found that the ant-aphid mutualism accounted for much of the variation underlying ant impact on cotton herbivores and predators. For example, in 2001, similar to 27\% of herbivore taxa and 54\% of predator taxa were adversely affected by the mutualism. The overall community response, however, was highly conditional with strong temporal variation in the effects of the ant-aphid association. Our results indicate that the relationship between fire ants and aphids serves as a key interaction that alters the structure of cotton arthropod communities. This conclusion has far-reaching significance for understanding food web dynamics in natural systems and the efficacy of biological control in ant-infested areas.},

Most studies of plant-animal interactions have been performed only in natural settings, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of traits and context. To assess the relative importance of trait differences and environmental context for among-population variation in plant resistance to herbivory, we compared oviposition by the butterfly Anthocharis cardamines on two ploidy types of the herb Cardamine pratensis under experimentally controlled conditions with oviposition in natural populations. Under controlled conditions, plants from octoploid populations were significantly more preferred than plants from tetraploid populations. This difference was largely mediated by differences in flower size. Among natural populations, there was no difference in oviposition rates between the two ploidy types. Our results suggest that differences in oviposition rates among populations of the two cytotypes in the field are caused mainly by differences in environmental context, and that the higher attractiveness of octoploids to herbivores observed under common environmental conditions is balanced by the fact that they occur in habitats which harbor lower densities of butterflies. This illustrates that spatial variation in biotic interactions is the net result of differences in trait distributions of the interacting organisms and differences in environmental context, and that variation in both traits and context are important in understanding species interactions.},

We decompose network dissimilarity into interactions and species turnover components, so that it is immediately comparable to common measures of {$\beta$}-diversity.

Here we argue that the current conceptualization of species interaction networks is ill-suited for this task. Instead, we propose that future research must start to account for the intrinsic variability of species interactions, then scale up from here onto complex networks. This can be accomplished simply by recognizing that there exists intra-specific variability, in traits or properties related to the establishment of species interactions.

When applied to non-probabilistic data, the measures we present give the same results as their non-probabilistic formulations, meaning that they can be generally applied. * We present three case studies that highlight how these measures can be used, in re-analysing data that experimentally measured the variability of interactions, to alleviate the computational demands of permutation-based approaches, and to use the frequency at which interactions are observed over several locations to infer the structure of local networks. We provide a free and open-source implementation of these measures. * We discuss how both sampling and data representation of ecological networks can be adapted to allow the application of a fully probabilistic numerical network approach.},

  abstract = {AIM: Although there is a vast body of literature on the causes of variation in species composition in ecological communities, less effort has been invested in understanding how interactions between these species vary. Since interactions are crucial to the structure and functioning of ecological communities, we need to develop a better understanding of their spatial dynamics. Here, we apply novel numerical tools to data on species interactions, and reveal that they vary more, and in response to different climate variables, than species do. LOCATION: Eurasia. METHODS: We used a measure of Locality Contribution to Beta-Diversity to evaluate the compositional uniqueness of 51 host\textendash parasite communities across Eurasia, using publicly available data. We measured uniqueness based on the species composition, and based on potential and realized biotic interactions. RESULTS: We show that interactions vary more, over space, than species do. In particular, we show that interactions respond to some climatic variables that have no effect on species distribution or dissimilarity. MAIN CONCLUSIONS: Species interactions provide far more resolution than species occurrences alone, while still retaining all information about species occurrences. We suggest that they be put front and center in analyses of communities, especially in a biogeographic context.},

  abstract = {Both species and their interactions are affected by changes that occur at evolutionary time-scales, and shape both ecological communities and their phylogenetic structure. But because extent ecological community structure is contingent upon random chance, environmental filters, and local effects, it is unclear how much ecological signal local communities should retain. Here we show that, in a host\textendash parasite system where species interactions vary substantially over a continental gradient, the ecological significance of individual interactions is maintained across different scales. Notably, this occurs despite the fact that observed community variation at the local scale frequently tends to weaken or remove community-wide phylogenetic signal. When considered in terms of the interplay between community ecology and coevolutionary theory, our results demonstrate that individual interactions are capable and indeed likely to show a consistent signature of past evolutionary history even when woven into communities that do not.

  abstract = {Knowledge of feeding rates is the basis to understand interaction strength and subsequently the stability of ecosystems and biodiversity. Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer-resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer-resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass- and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure.},

These changes can be broadly grouped according to three nonexclusive mechanisms: (a) changes in the species composition of the networks (driven by interaction patterns of invaders, nonrandom extinction of species according to their traits, or differences among species in population responses across gradients); (b) changes that alter interaction frequencies via changes in search efficiency (driven by altered habitat structure or metabolic rates) or changes in spatial and temporal overlap; and (c) changes to coevolutionary processes and patterns. Taking spatial and temporal processes into account can further elucidate network variation and improve predictions of network responses to environmental change.
